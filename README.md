# gait_simulation_package
Set of scripts and setup files for simulating gait using opensim using MATLAB &amp; C++

Originally developed for MATLAB 2017b & OpenSim3.3

Tools for reading .c3d data, and subsequently writing the appropriate .xml/ .mot files for OpenSim heavily based on SimTK: Matlab-OpenSim Interfaces (https://simtk.org/projects/matlab_tools)
