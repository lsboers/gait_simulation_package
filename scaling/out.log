Processing subject staticP122_SCALED

Step 1: Loading generic model
Loaded model staticP122_SCALED from file ../skeletal_models/staticP122_fullbody7_SCALED.osim

Step 2: Scaling generic model
Wrote model file Unassigned from model staticP122_SCALED
Wrote scale file Unassigned for model staticP122_SCALED

Step 3: Placing markers on model
Loaded marker file ../experimental_data/staticP122.trc (53 markers, 100 frames)
Averaged frames from time 0.5 to 1 in ../experimental_data/staticP122.trc (frames 50 to 100)
Deleted 0 unused markers from model staticP122_SCALED
Frame at (t=0):	total squared error = 0.0120936, marker error: RMS=0.0194403, max=0.045409 (RHLE)
Moved markers in model staticP122_SCALED to match locations in marker file ../experimental_data/staticP122.trc
Wrote model file ../skeletal_models/staticP122_fullbody7_SCALED.osim from model staticP122_SCALED
